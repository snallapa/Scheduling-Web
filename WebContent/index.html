					<h2>Overview</h2>
				</header>
				<section>
					<h3>A Brief Introduction</h3>
					<p>The Seven Hills Foundation in Worcester Massachusetts offers services to people with a wide array of cognitive and physical
						disabilities. These disabilities make performing everyday tasks challenging. The primary goal of this project is to specifically
						address the clientsâ€™ need for accessing and remembering their schedules at Seven Hills. The project also intends to create
						an easier way for the staff of Seven Hills to manage the schedules of the participants. Users are encouraged to contact Team
						Cerebellum with any questions they may have regarding the Web App its features.</p>
					<hr />

						<h3>Background</h3>
					</header>
					<p>The ages of the participants at the Aspire! Worcester Program range from 20 to 60. Most of the participants at the center
						have Down syndrome: a genetic disorder that presents a variety of symptoms ranging from cognitive disabilities to physical
						impairments. While therapy and training can help participants overcome most physical issues, one disability that hinders
						patients is a low IQ. The faculty at the Seven Hills facility must work around this disorder by providing simple instructions
						and easy to follow rules that the participants can understand. The faculty must be careful to support and respect the participants
						while providing them with enough freedom so they can enjoy their time at the program.</p>
					<p>According to the Assistive Technology Program Director, Mrs. Jean Des Roches, there are approximately twenty iPads that
						the participants are allowed to sign out and use. The intent of the iPads was to allow the participants to learn to use modern
						technology and apply the technology in their daily lives. However, shortly after the iPads were introduced to the facility,
						many of the participants found them difficult to use and stopped using them all together. Now, the participants only use
						the iPads for entertainment: watching movies and television shows. Because many of the participants have a cognitive disadvantage,
						they are unable to use complex apps with several buttons and options. While many apps exist that are simple to use, most
						of these are directed toward an age inappropriate audience, and many of the participants would feel patronized to use apps
						that were designed for elementary students. As a result, the iPads are not used to the extent to which they can be used.</p>
					<p>At the program, the participants are able to participate in a range of activities and plan their own schedules for the week.
						One of the rules of the facility is that the schedules need to be reviewed by the faculty before they can be approved. The
						current method that participants use to generate their schedules is archaic: writing schedules by hand. Not only is it difficult
						for the faculty to manage these schedules, but also it is difficult for the participants to see their own schedules. Because
						they can be forgetful, the participants need easy access to their own schedules to avoid chaos and confusion. This problem
						pertains to many of the participants of the Seven Hills facility, and they would all benefit from a simple way to view their
						weekly schedules.</p>
